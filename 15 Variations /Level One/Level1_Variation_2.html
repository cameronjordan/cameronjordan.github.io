<h2>By Experimental Jetset</h2> </left>


      <p><b>Authors foreword</b></p>
      <p> We wrote the following manifesto nine years ago.
        <br> It was written to function within a very specific context: we were invited to deliver a lecture at the first AIGA “Voice” convention, that was scheduled to take place towards the end of 2001, in Washington DC.
        <br> <p/>
<p>&nbsp; Instead of a lecture, we planned to do something else.
  <br> During the convention, we wanted to do a series of ‘hand–out sessions’, distributing stickersheets featuring abstract&nbsp;&nbsp; wristbands, &nbsp;&nbsp;nametags and &nbsp;&nbsp;badges.
  <br> This stickersheet was printed in three different colours (&nbsp;&nbsp;red, &nbsp;&nbsp;blue and &nbsp;&nbsp;red). <br> How we envisioned it, the people attending the convention would wear these abstract stickers, forming three different &nbsp;&nbsp;‘political parties’ &nbsp;&nbsp;(a red party, a blue party and a black party), creating a sort of site–specific artwork.<br> We were very much inspired by the fact that the convention took place in Washington DC, and wanted to create a work that would refer to &nbsp;&nbsp;political rallies, &nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrations, &nbsp;&nbsp;protests, &nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic and &nbsp;&nbsp;Republic conventions, etc.
  <br> </p>

<p> &nbsp;On the back of the stickersheet, we printed a &nbsp;&nbsp;manifesto.<br>
   In retrospect, this &nbsp;&nbsp;manifesto didn’t have a lot to do with the front of the stickersheet.<br>
   But at that time, we felt the manifesto was necessary, to clarify our views on &nbsp;&nbsp;graphic design.<br> Re–reading the &nbsp;&nbsp;manifesto now, we fully realize the &nbsp;&nbsp;manifesto would sooner confuse our <br>ideas<br> than clarify them.<br>
In the end, it didn’t really matter.<br> We never made it to Washington to hand out the stickersheets.<br> Because of the ‘9/11’ attacks on the World Trade Center and the &nbsp;&nbsp;Pentagon, the ‘Voice’ conference was &nbsp;c&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;c&nbsp;e&nbsp;l&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;d.<br> The stickersheets were already printed by then.<br> </p>
<p> &nbsp; Most of the stickersheets were distributed by A&nbsp;I&nbsp;G&nbsp;A, as part of a mailing.<br> Some stickersheets were enclosed in issue 4 of the magazine <br>Dot<br>Dot<br>Dot.<br> The manifesto was also published by a German magazine called P&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;s&nbsp;p&nbsp;e&nbsp;k&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;v&nbsp;e, together with an accompanying interview, which was also published by <br>Dot<br> Dot<br> Dot.<br> And that was the end of the manifesto.<br>
Looking at the m&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;i&nbsp;f&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;o now, we see a lot of small things we don’t agree with.<br> First of all, we think the title should have been “N&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;–&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;ationism” instead of “D&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;m”. Moreover, the categories of <br> ‘r&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n’ <br> and <br> ‘d&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;–or n&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;–&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n’ <br> are not really part of our thinking anymore.<br> We also used some other words in the manifesto (‘functionality’ and ‘amoralism’) that we would never use now;<br> in fact, looking back at our body of work,<br> we think our work has been very m&nbsp;o&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;l&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;c,<br> from the very &nbsp; start. </p>
<p> &nbsp; However,<br> re–reading the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;i&nbsp;f&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;o,<br> we also see a lot of things we still agree with.<br> For example,<br> we still believe that the political qualities of graphic design are situated foremost in its aesthetic dimension,<br> and not necessarily in the direct message it tries to deliver.<br> Furthermore,<br> we are still very interested in the idea of a graphic design that refers to its own material context.<br> And lastly,<br> after all these years,<br> we would still never work for an advertising agency.<br> So in that sense,<br> we still feel connected to the m&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;i&nbsp;f&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;o. </p>

<br>&nbsp; and revolutionary role of graphic design.

<br>
&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;representationism </p>

<ol>

  <p>In his vicious 1923 manifesto ‘Anti-Tendenzkunst’,<br> architect,<br> artist and De Stijl founder Theo van Doesburg stated that “as obvious as it may sound,<br> there is no structural difference between a painting that depicts Trotsky heading a red army,<br> and a painting that depicts Napoleon heading an imperial army.<br> It is irrelevant whether a piece of art promotes either proletarian or patriotic values”.<br>
This qoute can be easily misunderstood as blatantly apolitical,<br> but in our humble opinion,<br> it is far from that.<br> In Van Doesburg’s view,<br> it doesn’t really matter what a painting depicts;<br> it is the act of depiction itself,<br> the process of representation,<br> that he regards as highly anti-revolutionary.<br>
Van Doesburg and many other modernists saw &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;representative art as inherently bourgeois;<br> suggestive,<br> tendentious and false.<br> Regardless of the subject.
</p>

Although formulated almost a century ago,<br> we,<br> as Experimental Jetset,<br> have to admit we feel a certain affinity for Van Doesburg’s ‘anti-tendentious’ ideas.<br>
Although at first sight it might seem impossible to differentiate between ‘presentative’ and ‘representative’ graphic design,<br> we do think it is possible to make a distinction of some sort.<br>
For example,<br> it’s hard to deny that most
<br> g&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;p&nbsp;h&nbsp;i&nbsp;c d&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;i&nbsp;g&nbsp;n
<br> produced within the context of <br>advertising <br> is inherently <br> representative.<br> No surprise, since the very concept of advertising is one of the purest forms of representation.<br> As per definition,<br> advertising never “is” in itself,<br> it always “is about” something else. <br>
Advertising is a phenomenon that constantly dissolves its own physical appearance,<br> in order to describe and represent appearances other than itself.<br> Whereas presentative graphic design seems to underline its own physical appearance,<br> even when it is referring to subjects other than itself.<br>

<br>
  Having said all this,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> we like to point out that our criticism of <br>a&nbsp;d&nbsp;v&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;i&nbsp;n&nbsp;g <br>is fundamentally different than the criticism expressed in the 2000 First Things First manifesto.<br> Other than the signatories to that manifesto,<br> we see no structural difference between social,<br> cultural and commercial graphic design.<br> Every cause that is formulated outside of a design context,<br> and superficially imposed on a piece of d&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;i&nbsp;g&nbsp;n,<br> is t&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;s,<br> representative,<br> and thus reactionary,<br> whether it deals with corporate interests or social causes.<br>  Likewise,<br> we see no structural difference between advertising and ‘anti-advertising’.<br> The former tries to sell you product X,<br> the latter tells you not to buy product X, <br> but on a fundamental level they are completely alike. <br> They both contribute to what Guy Debord was so fond of referring to as “the society of the spectacle”:<br> a world of representation and alienation.<br> </p>

 <p> Other representative tendencies in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graphic design&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include the fact that nowadays more and more designers refer to their profession in (immaterial) terms such as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>  ‘v&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;u&nbsp;a&nbsp;l communication’,<br> ‘information a&nbsp;r&nbsp;c&nbsp;h&nbsp;i&nbsp;t&nbsp;e&nbsp;c&nbsp;t&nbsp;u&nbsp;r&nbsp;e’,<br> etc.<br> These particular notions painfully show the shift in graphic design towards the denial and neglect of its own physical dimensions.</p>
