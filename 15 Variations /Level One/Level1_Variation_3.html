Disrepresentation<br> Now<br>
By<br> Experimental<br> Jetset<br>


      <p> <b>Authors <br>foreword</b> </p>
      <p> We<br> wrote<br> the<br> following<br><br><br><br> manifesto<br><br><br><br> nine years ago.<br> It<br> was <br> written <br> to <br><br><br><br> function <br><br><br><br> within <br> a  <br> very <br> specific <br> context:<br> we were invited to deliver a lecture at the first AIGA “Voice” convention, that was scheduled to take place towards the end of 2001, in Washington DC.<br> <p/>
<p>&nbsp; Instead of a lecture, we planned to do something else.<br> During the convention, we wanted to do a series of ‘hand–out sessions’, distributing stickersheets featuring abstract wristbands, nametags and badges.<br> This stickersheet was printed in three different colours (red, blue and red). <br> How we envisioned it, the people attending the convention would wear these abstract stickers, forming three different ‘political parties’ (a red party, a blue party and a black party), creating a sort of site–specific artwork.<br> We were very much inspired by the fact that the convention took place in Washington DC, and wanted to create a work that would refer to political rallies, demonstrations, protests, Democratic and Republic conventions, etc.<br> </p>
<p> &nbsp;On the back of the stickersheet, we printed a manifesto.<br> In retrospect, this manifesto didn’t have a lot to do with the front of the stickersheet.<br> But at that time, we felt the manifesto was necessary, to clarify our views on graphic design.<br> Re–reading the manifesto now, we fully realize the manifesto would sooner confuse our ideas than clarify them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it<br> didn’t<br> really<br><br><br><br> matter.<br> We never made it to <br><br><br><br>Washington <br><br><br><br> to hand out the stickersheets.<br> Because of the ‘9/11’ attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the ‘Voice’ conference was cancelled.<br> The stickersheets were already printed by then.<br> </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the stickersheets were distributed by AIGA, as part of a mailing.<br> Some stickersheets were enclosed in issue 4 of the magazine Dot Dot Dot.<br> The manifesto was also published by a German magazine called Perspektive, together with an accompanying interview, which was also published by Dot Dot Dot.<br> And that was the end of the manifesto.<br>
Looking at the manifesto now, we see a lot of small things we don’t agree with.<br> First of all, we think the title should have been “Non–representationism” instead of “Disrepresentationism”. Moreover, the categories of ‘representation’ and ‘dis–or non–represenation’ are not really part of our thinking anymore.<br> We also used some other words in the manifesto (‘functionality’ and ‘amoralism’) that we would never use now;<br> in fact, looking back at our body of work,<br> we think our work has been very moralistic,<br> from the very &nbsp; start. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,<br><br><br><br> re–reading the manifesto,<br> we also see a lot of things we still agree with.<br> For example,<br> we still believe that the political qualities of graphic design are situated foremost in its aesthetic dimension,<br> and not necessarily in the direct message it tries to deliver.<br> Furthermore,<br> we are still very interested in the idea of a graphic design that refers to its own material context.<br> And lastly,<br> after all these years,<br> we would still never work for an advertising agency.<br> So in that sense,<br> we still feel connected to the m&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;i&nbsp;f&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;o. </p>

  <p>In his<br> vicious<br> 1923 manifesto <br>‘Anti-Tendenzkunst’<br>,<br> architect,<br> artist and <br><br>De Stijl<br><br><br> founder <br><br><br>Theo van Doesburg<br><br><br> stated that<br><br> “as obvious as it may sound,<br><br> there is no structural difference between a painting that depicts Trotsky heading a red army,<br> and a painting that depicts Napoleon heading an imperial army.<br> It is irrelevant whether a piece of art promotes either proletarian or patriotic values”.<br>
This qoute can be easily misunderstood as blatantly apolitical,<br> but in our humble opinion,<br> it is far from that.<br> In Van Doesburg’s view,<br> it doesn’t really matter what a painting depicts;<br> it is the act of depiction itself,<br> the process of representation,<br> that he regards as highly anti-revolutionary.<br>
Van Doesburg and many other modernists saw representative art as inherently bourgeois;<br> suggestive,<br> tendentious and false.<br> Regardless of the subject.
</p>

Although formulated almost a century ago,<br> we,<br> as Experimental Jetset,<br> have to admit we feel a certain affinity for Van Doesburg’s ‘anti-tendentious’ ideas.<br>
Although at first sight it might seem impossible to differentiate between ‘presentative’ and ‘representative’ graphic design,<br> we do think it is possible to make a distinction of some sort.<br>
For example,<br> it’s hard to deny that most <br><br>graphic design<br><br> produced within the context of <br><br>advertising<br><br> is inherently <br><br>representative.<br><br> No surprise, since the very concept of <br><br>advertising<br><br> is one of the purest forms of representation.<br> As per definition,<br> advertising never “is” in itself,<br> it always “is about” something else. <br>
Advertising is a phenomenon that constantly dissolves its own physical appearance,<br> in order to describe and represent appearances other than itself.<br> Whereas presentative graphic design seems to underline its own physical appearance,<br> even when it is referring to subjects other than itself.<br>

<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all this,<br> we like to point out that our criticism of advertising is fundamentally different than the criticism expressed in the 2000 First Things First manifesto.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the signatories to that manifesto,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we see no structural difference between social,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cultural and commercial graphic design.<br> Every cause that is formulated outside of a design context,<br> and superficially imposed on a piece of design,<br> is t&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;s,<br> representative,<br> and thus reactionary,<br> whether it deals with corporate interests or social causes.<br>  Likewise,<br> we see no structural difference between advertising and ‘anti-advertising’.<br> The former tries to sell you product X,<br> the latter tells you not to buy product X, <br> but on a fundamental level they are completely alike. <br> They both contribute to what Guy Debord was so fond of referring to as “the society of the spectacle”:<br> a world of representation and alienation.<br> </p>

 <p> Other representative tendencies in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graphic design&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include the fact that nowadays more and more designers refer to their profession in (immaterial) terms such as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> ‘visual communication’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘information architecture’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,<br> etc.<br> These particular notions painfully show the shift in graphic design towards the denial and neglect of its own physical dimensions.</p>
