   <div id="mf1">

    In Van Doesburg’s view, it doesn’t really matter what a painting depicts;<br>
     it is the act of <u> depiction</u> itself,
     <br>the process of <u>representation</u>,
     <br>that he regards as highly anti-revolutionary.

  Although at first sight it might seem impossible to differentiate between ‘presentative’ and ‘representative’ graphic design,
  <br> we do think it is possible to make a distinction of some sort.

<div id="threem">

Advertising is a phenomenon that constantly dissolves its own physical appearance,
<br> in order to describe and represent appearances other than itself.
<br>Whereas presentative graphic design seems to underline its own physical appearance,
<br>even when it is referring to subjects other than itself.

<div id="four">

Likewise, we see no structural difference between advertising and ‘anti-advertising’.
<br> The former tries to sell you product X, the latter tells you not to buy product X,
<br> but on a fundamental level they are completely alike.
<br> They both contribute to what Guy Debord was so fond of referring to as “the society of the spectacle”:
<br> a world of representation and alienation.
